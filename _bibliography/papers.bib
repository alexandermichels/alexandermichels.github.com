  abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis article and associated materials are based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant numbers: 1443080 and 1743184.

    abstract = {Despite extensive efforts on achieving reproducible agent-based models (ABMs) to improve the capability of this widely adopted methodology, it remains challenging to reproduce and replicate pre-existing ABMs, due to a number of factors such as diverse computing resources and ABMs platforms. In this study, we propose to employ CyberGIS-Jupyter for spatially explicit ABMs. CyberGIS-Jupyter is a cyberGIS framework to achieve data-intensive, reproducible, and scalable geospatial analytics using Jupyter Notebook based on advanced cyberinfrastructure. Influenza transmission in the city of Miami, Florida, USA was used as a case study. In the model, Influenza is transmitted through the contact networks of individual human agents, which are constructed based on commuting behaviors. CyberGIS-Jupyter can support one not only to conduct collaborative and transparent modeling, but also to perform modeling simulation on advanced cyberinfrastructure resources. It may contribute to boosting the reproducibility and replicability of ABMs.},
