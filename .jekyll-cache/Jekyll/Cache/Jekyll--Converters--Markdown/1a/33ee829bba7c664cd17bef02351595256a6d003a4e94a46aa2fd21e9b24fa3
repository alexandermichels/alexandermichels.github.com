I"	<p>I am happy to announce I was part of a great group of researchers at the CyberGIS Center who have put together a paper examining spatial accessibility to crucial COVID-19 healthcare resources in Illinois.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093534v1">preprint can be found on medRvix</a> and the abstract for the paper is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only did we calculate accessibility to make policy recommendations, our measures are re-calculated daily and included into the <a href="https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/">CIGI WhereCOVID-19 analytics dashboard</a> so we can understand how accessibility changes as infrastructure and cases do.</p>

<p><strong>Update 27/08/20</strong>: Our paper has been accepted to the International Journal of Health Geographics!</p>
