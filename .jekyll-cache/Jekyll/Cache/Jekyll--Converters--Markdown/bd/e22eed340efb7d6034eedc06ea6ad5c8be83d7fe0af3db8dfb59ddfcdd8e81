<p>I’m currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I’m pursuing a <a href="http://www.informatics.illinois.edu/informatics-phd/">doctorate in Informatics</a> with a focus in Spatial Informatics. At UIUC I work as a research assistant under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the <a href="http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/">CyberInfrastructure &amp; Geospatial Information Laboratory (CIGI)</a> and <a href="http://cybergis.illinois.edu/">CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies</a>. In these labs, I am part of the “Algorithms &amp; Systems” and “Spatial Modeling” groups which allows me to explore deploying complex systems on Kubernetes and simulating complex socio-economic phenomena.</p>

<p>I have an interdisciplinary background which includes a Bachelors in Mathematics and Financial Economics with Honors in Computer Science and Math. This interdisciplinary undergrad from a liberal arts institution is now being supplemented by an intersectional graduate program that fits my research interests perfectly. I’m passionate about solving complex, data-driven, socio-economic problems involving space and connectivity, spurred on by an interest in graph theory and topology.</p>
