          <p>As we have seen, the problem of filtering misinformation out is both a crucial and challenging one, but how can it be accomplished? This is a burgeoning area of research given recent events. Promising and innovative techniques such as those proposed by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2996453">Wu et al.</a> check the sensitivity of a claim by examining how the strength of the claim changes as the parameters of the claim vary slightly. The vast amounts of relational information available and the relational tools available for manipulating them has lead many to search for answers through <a href="https://alexandermichels.github.io/blog/KnowledgeGraphs101.html">knowledge graphs</a>. The problem then becomes: given a knowledge graph populated with true facts, how can one discern if a new fact is true or false?</p>

          <center>

              <img alt="Twitter Network of Misinformation" src="../images/AnatomyOfAMisinformationNetwork.png"  style="max-width:90%;">

            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>The graph structure of the data amplifies the benefits of the hierarchical structure of the ontology through transitivity. Using transitivity, we can infer new facts about the entities in our graph using the relations between the entities and the type constraints. As an example, if we have know ("Mr. X", "was born in", "Boston") and ("Boston", "city in", "United States"), we can infer that ("Mr. X", "was born in", "United States"). The transitivity of relations between entities in a knowledge graph is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations. There must be a law of diminishing returns when we say that an entity <b>x</b> is related to another entity </b>z</b> because both <b>x</b> and <b>z</b> are related to <b>y</b>. If there is not, we quickly get connected components which are complete graphs, although we know that the true number of correct relations is sparse. Thus, when considering relating entities through transitivity, we take into consideration the path length.</p>

          <center><h2 id="klinker">Knowledge Linker and Relational Knowledge Linker</h2></center>

          <p>In a knowledge graph, there may be many paths from a subject to an object even of the same path length, but each of them provides different factual support for their relation by the chain of entities and relations which bring them together. As an example, paths containing generic concepts such as ``Male'' are less likely to provide specific support for our target subject and object being related than paths containing only specific concepts [1]. To formalize this intuition, this is called the <b>semantic proximity</b> and is defined as</p>

          <center>
            <figure >
              <img alt="" src="../images/SemanticProximity1Eq.png"  style="width:50%; max-width:90%;">
              <figcaption>Equation 1. Semantic Proximity on Knowledge Graphics [1]</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>where <b>k(v)</b> is the degree of entity <b>v</b> [1]. Defining the truth value of a relation <b>T(s,p,o) &#8712; [0,1]</b> to be max <b>W(P<sub>s,o</sub>)</b> gives a truth values which maximizes the semantic proximity, is equivalent to finding the shortest path, and provides the maximum information content [1]. This approach to Computational Fact-Checking is called Knowledge Linker [1].</p>

          <center>
            <figure >
              <img alt="Semantic Proximity Measure for Fact-Checking on Knowledge Graphs" src="../images/ObamaMuslimKnowledgeNetwork.PNG"  style="width:60%; max-width:90%;">
              <figcaption>A path from Barack Obama to Islam containing the very non-specific entity, Canada. The numbers in parentheses denote the degree of the node. [1]</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>This approach was extended and improved on by capturing the semantic similarity of the relations along the path, an approach known as Relational Knowledge Linker [3]. This is achieved using the line graph of the knowledge graph [3]. Letting <b>R</b> be the set of types of relations in the graph, the adjacency matrix of the line graph of a knowledge graph, <b>C</b>, is an |<b>R</b>| x |<b>R</b>|  matrix representing the co-occurrences of <b>R</b> [3]. In order to not have the matrix dominated by the most common relationships, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is then applied to <b>C</b> to produce <b>C'</b> using the following equations:</p>


            <center>
              <figure >
                <img alt="" src="../images/Co-occurenceMatrixOfKG.png"  style="width:50%; max-width:90%;">
                <figcaption>Equation 2. Calculating and Normalizing the Co-Occurence Matrix of Relations in a Knowledge Graphs [3]</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </center>

          <p>The rows of <b>C'</b> are then treated as feature vectors of the relations they represent. The relational similarity, <b>u</b>, between relations <b>r<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>r<sub>j</sub></b>, is defined as <b>u(r<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>j</sub>)</b> equals the cosine similarity of the <b>i</b>-th and <b>j</b>-th rows of <b>C'</b> [3]. With this definition of relational similarity, we can replace the notion of path specificity or semantic proximity laid in Equation 1 with:

            <center>
              <figure >
                <img alt="" src="../images/SemanticProximity2Eq.png"  style="width:50%; max-width:90%;">
                <figcaption> Equation 3. An improved measure for Semantic Proximity using Relational Similarity [3]</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </center>

          <p>where again <b>k</b> is the degree of the node [3].</p>

          <center><h2 id="kstream">Knowledge Stream</h2></center>

          <p>A single path may not capture the true semantic similarity between the two target entities however, and as previously stated a large part of fact-checking is putting the fact into its broader context. The former approach also ignores the relations along the path and the type of entities, only taking into consideration the degree of the node. Another approach to computational fact-checking on knowledge graphs considers a larger subset of the graph as its context and uses the similarities between the ontological relations to help determine which paths are more semantically meaningful for the target relation.</p>

          <center>
            <figure align="center" >
              <img alt="Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs" src="../images/FindingStreamsinKnowledgeGraphs.jpg"  style="max-width:90%;">
              <figcaption>Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs [3]</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>The approach is called Knowledge Stream because it treats computational fact-checking as a network flow problem, determining how much information it can push from subject to object [3]. It labels the relational edges along the way with capacities as a function of how semantically similar they are to the target relation and costs to traverse nodes which are a function of the degree of the node [3].</p>

          <p>More specifically, the lower bound of each edge (the required flow) is zero and the upper bound (capacity) of each edge <b>e = (v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>)</b> for subject-predicate-object triple <b>(s,p,o)</b> is</p>

          <center>
            <figure >
              <img alt="" src="../images/KSTREAMCapacities.jpg"  style="width:50%; max-width:90%;">
              <figcaption>Equation 4. Calculating the capacities of edges for Knowledge Stream [3]</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>where <b>u</b> is the relational similarity between the edge label <b>g(e)</b> and the target predicate <b>p</b> and <b>k</b> is the degree of the node [3]. The cost of each edge <b>e = (v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>)</b> is the generality of the object node log(<b>k(v<sub>j</sub>)</b>) [3]. With these constraints, the problem is then turned into a minimum cost maximum flow problem, which is a commonly studied problem in computer science and the solution is optimized using Successive Shortest Path  on the residual network [3].</p>

          <center><h2 id="predpath">PredPath</h2></center>

          <p>Our last method, PredPath, attempts to learn what examples of the target relation looks like from the graph itself and then determines if the target relation fits in with what it has learned. It abstracts the subject and object and tries to understand what it means for the more generalized subject and object to be related by the target relation, much like a human fact-checker would [2]. Given the statement "<b>Chicago is the capital of Illinois</b>," the model abstracts <b>Chicago</b> to <b>U.S. City</b> and <b>Illinois</b> to <b>U.S. State</b> then tries to understand what it means for a <b>U.S. City</b> to be <b>capitalOf</b> a <b>U.S. State</b> [2].</p>

          <center>

              <img alt="Discriminitive Predicate Path Mining for Fact-Checking" src="../images/PredicateMining.jpg"  style="max-width:90%;">
              <figcaption>An overview of how PredPath works [2]</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>

          <p>The method begins by specializing the concept of a path to knowledge graphs. A <b>Meta Path</b> on a knowledge graph <b>G</b> is a directed, typed sequence of vertices and edges <b>P<sup>k</sup> = o<sub>1</sub> &rarr; p<sub>1</sub> &rarr; o<sub>2</sub> &rarr; p<sub>2</sub> ... &rarr; p<sub>k-1</sub> &rarr; o<sub>k</sub></b> in <b>G</b> where <b>o<sub>i</sub></b> denotes nodes in <b>G</b> and <b>&rarr; p<sub>i</sub> &rarr;</b> denotes an edge in <b>G</b> [2]. An example of a meta path could be {U.S. City}&rarr;{headquarter}<sup>-1</sup>&rarr;{State Agency} &rarr; {jurisdiction} &rarr; {U.S. State} [2].</p>

          <p>Define an <b>Anchored Predicate Path</b> of length <b>k</b> to be a directed, typed sequence of edges with typed-endpoints <b>P<sup>k</sup> = o<sub>1</sub> &rarr; p<sub>1</sub> &rarr; &rarr; p<sub>2</sub> ... &rarr; p<sub>k-1</sub> &rarr; o<sub>k</sub></b> [2]. Essentially this is a meta path, without the intermediate nodes. A <b>Discriminative Paths</b> of length less than or equal to <b>k</b> to be a set <b>D<sup>k</sup><sub>(o<sub>u</sub>, o<sub>v</sub>)</sub></b> of anchored predicate paths that alternatively describe the give statement of fact <b>o<sub>u</sub> &rarr; p &rarr; o<sub>v</sub></b> with maximum path length <b>k</b> [2].</p>

          <p>PredPath views fact-checking as a supervised link prediction task; that is, given a subject-predicate-object triple <b>(s,p,o)</b>, they want to know if the fact is implied by the information already in the graph [2]. This is done by generating a set of positive training examples <b>T<sup>+</sup> = {(u,v) | u &rarr; p &rarr; v &#8712; <b>G</b>}</b> and negative training examples <b>T<sup>+</sup> = {(u,v) | u &rarr; p &rarr; v &notin; <b>G</b>}</b> where <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> have the same type, connectivity, etc. as <b>s</b> and <b>t</b> respectively [2].</p>
