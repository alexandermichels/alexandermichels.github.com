          <p>I apologize for the long absense from my blog, it has been a very busy few months with no signs of letting up, but I'm going to try to keep updating things here. Not only is it my final year at Westminster College, I'm also working a few jobs, applying to Doctoral programs, conducting research, interviewing to work as researcher this summer, and trying to fit in concerts when I can. I have a lot to tell you all about so let's dive into it all!</p>

          <center><h2>Titan Radio, Networking, and Galois</h2></center>

            <p>One of my many hats is as a software engineer and system administrator for Titan Radio and WCN 24/7 at Westminster College and it has been a very...eye opening few months. I theoretically knew a lot about computers, but this opportunity to get my hands dirty has allowed me to cement this knowledge and tackle a lot of interesting real-world problems in computing in a realm I really enjoy: music. My work at Titan Radio has given me a lot of hands-on experience with networks, servers, virtual machines, and the operating system cross-compatibility.</p>

            <p>Playing with all of these fun toys made me a bit jealous and with the research I've been working on, some of which I've discussed here before (<a href="https://alexandermichels.github.io/blog/ComputationalFact-Checking.html">here for computational fact-checking</a> and <a href="https://alexandermichels.github.io/blog/WhatIsHierarchicalTemporalMemory.html">here for Hierarchical Temporal Memory</a>) and will go into some depth a bit later, I have been desiring another computer besides my laptop. While I was discussing my lack of computing power and the costs of acquiring it one night with my roommate, he suggested purchasing a server from Ebay. At first it seemed crazy, but when I saw what I could get for a measly few hundred-and-fifty dollars, I was sold and purchased one within hours of our conversation.</p>

            <div align="center">
              <img alt="My server, Galois" src="../images/Galois.jpg" style="max-width:60%">
            </div>

            <p>That's how I met the love of my life, Galois: an <a href="https://h20195.www2.hpe.com/v2/getdocument.aspx?docname=c04199811">HP Proliant DL380 G7</a> server with two 6-core X5650 2.66GHz Xeon processors and 16Gb of RAM. However, Galois's low price came at a cost: he didn't have any drives and his 16GB of RAM were admirable, but not quite adequate for my 24-thread work-house who would soon be running discrimitive path mining and biologically inspired AI in parrallel. Fortunately, the <a href="https://my.westminster.edu/ics/Campus_Life/Campus_Groups/Drinko_Center/">Drinko Center</a> and my college's Honors Program were generous enough to provide me with some funding which has helped me get Galois an SSD, a couple of HDDs, and a whopping 128GB of RAM. I've very grateful to them for this incredible opportunity and excited to build my collection of computers and hopefully a homelab eventually.</p>

            <center><h2>On Intelligence and Paths to Truths</h2></center>

            <p>Galois has been an amazing boon to my research, helping me run long and intensive computational tasks without sacrificing my productivity. This has been crucial because I'm in he middle of working on two research projects: one <a href="https://github.com/alexandermichels/HTMResearch">investigating the capacity of Hierarchical Temporal Memory to learn variable-order time series</a> and the other on <a href="https://github.com/himahuja/StreamMiner">computational fact-checking using knowledge graphs</a> with the amazing Himanshu Ahuja. Not only has the work been exciting, interesting, and instructive, it will be giving me the opportunity to travel and once again present my work!</p>

            </div>

            <p style="visibility:hidden">break</p>

            <p>In January, I'll be presenting my work on computational fact-checking at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore. Specifically, I'll be giving a talk entitled, "Computational Fact-Checking through Relational Similarity based Path Mining" at the  <a href="https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2019/2217_progfull.html?fbclid=IwAR0AccnUi_yuX4UdnTVF-cCFVJ5lNYAdIvzw7TPS81eGXk1pn5PvQjaGyTo#2217:AMSCP33">AMS Contributed Paper Session on Operations Research, Mathematical Programming, Optimization, Game Theory, Economics, and Mathematics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences</a> as well as presenting my work at the <a href="https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/member-communities/students/undergraduate-research/maa-undergraduate-student-poster-session">Undergraduate Poster Session</a>. Then, in the spring of 2019, I will be defending my research in HTMs as part of my Honors Thesis at Westminster College and at Westminster's Undergraduate Research and Arts Celebration.</p>

            <p>It cannot be understated how amazingly thankful I am to my friends, family, and especially the incredible professors at Westminster College for helping me to be where I am today. Dr. Carolyn Cuff turned a lazy pre-Law student into a Mathematician and inspired my passion for math and operations research which was reinforced by Dr. Natacha Merz and Dr. Pamela Richardson. Dr. John Bonomo and Dr. C David Shaffer took a kid who knew nothing about computers and in just two short years had him writing software, designing networks, and researching cutting-edge artificial intelligence. They have truly changed my lives. I have a few more people to thank, because my research and opportunties to travel and present have been made possible by the funding, research grants, and travel grants I have recieved from the the Drinko Center, the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA, the National Science Foundation, Predicat Inc., and Westminster's Honors Program.</p>

            <p>So that's what I've been up to! Lots of working, homework, drafting statements of purpose, filling out applications, tons of research, and never a dull moment. Hopefully it will all pay off soon enough and I'll be blogging from a Ph.D. program next year!</p>
