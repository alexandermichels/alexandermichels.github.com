  <p>I recently had the pleasure of giving a talk at the 2019 Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore, MD. It was an incredible opportunity to present mine and Himanshu's work on computational fact-checking. We were invited to give a talk during the <i>AMS Contributed Paper Session on Operations Research, Mathematical Programming, Optimization, Game Theory, Economics, and Mathematics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences</i> and also to participate in the Undergraduate Poster Session. Below you can check out the slides from my presentation (unfortunately Himanshu wasn't able to fly out) and check out our poster from the conference.</p>

   <p>The conference was not only an incredible opportunity to skip my first week of classes for the Spring 2019 semester, it was a lot of fun to hear about the amazing work happening in math around the world and make some great connections. I can't thank Westminster's Drinko Center and UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics enough for flying me out to Baltimore, paying for my registration, and covering my stay for the week. Besides getting to have fun at the Batlimore Convention Center, it was a great opportunity to see my incredible coworkers from RIPS again, many of whom were also at JMM presenting. We all got together and had a small reunion dinner Friday night which was a lot of fun!</p>

  <p>Fortunately I have good excuses to skip even more classes (as much as I love writing assembly language in my computer architecture class...) in the coming weeks and months as I've been invited to present my Honors Research on cortical learning algorithms at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research at Kennesaw State University and as I have for the last few years, I'll be presenting work at Westminster's Undergraduate Research and Arts festival. For the meantime though, I have to continue working through my last semester at Westminster. I am taking Computer Architecture and Database to get my fill of Computer Science courses, Investments to top off my Financial Economics major, Honors Research to prepare my Honors Defense, and Design Principles and Practices (Graphic Design) to get my Visual and Performing Arts credit. </p>

  <p>I'm very happy to announce that I have more excuses to miss classes as well! I have been conducting interviews with some really incredible programs, have been invited to a few campus visits, and recieved some acceptances into doctoral programs, so I can finally say for certain that I will be purusing a doctorate staring in August although I am not exactly certain where. I'll be sure to do a write-up after I've made my final decision to make a list of programs with some commentary for those of you who may be interested in the intersection of computer science, math, and social sciences like I am and I look forward to announcing my decision after getting to spend some more time getting to know the various incredible professors who have reached out. I am incredibly lucky to be applying in a time where these programs are springing up and growing and I can't thank my teachers, professors, parents, and friends enough for getting me to where I am.</p>
