    <p>I am very happy to say that in February I was selected for UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics' <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2018/">Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS)</a>, and I still don't think I have really come to terms with the fact. I flew into beautiful Los Angeles, California at around 11 p.m. on Sunday, June 24th and even after I had gotten a ride to DeNeve Plaza, been handed my room card, and was walking through the gorgeous grounds to Fir Hall it didn't seem real. I am so amazingly grateful for this opportunity of a lifetime. I'm getting paid, housed, and fed to hang out with some of the most interesting people I've ever met, get to know world-class minds, enjoy the West Coast, and tackle interesting real-world problems in indisciplinary settings and I couldn't be happier.</p>

    <p>I'll be sure to post (what I am allowed to) on what I am doing here at RIPS in a later post and to update as I go because the work is very exciting, but I wanted to first post showing off this beautiful campus that I will definitely be applying to for graduate school and to talk about the amazing team I have. <a href="../docs/RIPS_2018_Yearbook.pdf">All of the people here are amazing</a>, but I have the pleasure of working closely with three teammates and an academic mentor on my project.</p>

    <p>The first person I will talk about is the man I have the pleasure of sharing an office with, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/babahooja/">Himanshu Ahuja</a>. This guy is a straight-up genius and is the most passionate person I have ever met. He loves artificial intelligence even more than I do and his dedication the pursuit of his dreams is inspiring. He definitely be making some headlines someday and I will be the annoying person who is constantly reminding everyone around him that I once shared an office with, jamming to Hindi music and the soundtrack to La La Land.</p>

    <p>Next up is our Project Manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liang-melody-shi-83077a115/">Liang (Melody) Shi</a>! An extremely-personable master of data science, I will not be suprised to see her as a CEO of an incredibly successful company or astonishing the world with her own innovative work in a few short years. Her intelligence, bubbly personality, and leadership qualities lead to the team unanimously agreeing that should take on the role of Project Manager at the beginning of day two.</p>

    <p>Last, but certainly not least is my good friend David Angeles. I cannot overstate how caring and extraordinary this man is. On top of that, he is coming into a project focused in Machine Learning with a Pure Mathematics background, little experience with programming and the web (HTML, HTTP requests/responses, etc.) and being asked (among other things) to write a web crawler. Without even batting an eye, David jumped straight in, soaking everything up and asking intelligent and insightful questions, inquiring beyond what he needed to know for the project, and providing new and interesting prospectives that none of the rest of us could have dreamed of. Although intelligence is an elusive concept to define, a common thread in attempts is an ability to adapt and learn. David has not only blown the rest of the team away in his drive and ability to learn, but also his capacity to hold his own after a couple days on a team where the rest of the members have lots of experience in computer science.</p>
