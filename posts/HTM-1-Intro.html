  <p>A while back I wrote <a href="https://alexandermichels.github.io/blog/WhatIsHierarchicalTemporalMemory.html">a very brief article on Hierachical Temporal Memory</a>, specifically talking about what it makes it different from other machine learning techniques, but it didn't give the theory justice, so I've decided to write a series of posts about my favorite model of intelligence. I hope others will read and become interested in computational neuroscience or at least <a href="https://numenta.com/">Numenta's work</a>.</p>

  <p>The theory beind Hierachical Temporal Memory and Cortical Learning Algorithms actually goes back to the 1978 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Benjamin_Mountcastle">Vernon Mountcastle</a> published his groundbreaking paper "An Organizing Principle for Cerebral Function: The Unit Model and the Distributed System" which proposed that all parts of the neocortex operated the same, with the cortical column acting as the unit of computation in the brain. This idea has been expanded on by neurosciencists and computer scientists science, and in 2004, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins">Jeff Hawkins</a> published his seminal <a href="https://numenta.com/resources/on-intelligence/"><i>On Intelligence</i></a> which outlined Hierarchical Temporal Memory which expanded upon Mountcastle's idea. The next year, Hawkins founded his computational neuroscience company, Numenta, to continue exploring the theory. Luckily for us, Numenta believes in open science, so their developments haven't been taking place behind closed doors. In 2010 they published a Cortical Learning Algorithm white paper which included a description of sequence memory and neuron model, and in 2013 they launched the Numenta Platform for Intelligence Computing open source implementation of HTMs. As they continue to fine tune their ideas, we are starting to see peer-reviewed publications out of Numenta and they are working on more and more complex problems such as sensorimotor processes.</p>

  <p>With all that said, there is no one better to tell you Numenta's story than Jeff Hawkins himself, so I'll let him:</p>

  <p>For those who can't wait for more or would just like a succint overview Numenta's work in neuroscience, I highly recommend checking out the following video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numenta">Numenta's YouTube channel</a>:</p>
