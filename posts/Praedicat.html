    <p>Now that I've settled in and gotten into the swing of things here at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics' Research in Industrial Projects for Students, I wanted to talk a bit about the project I am working on. There will be many follow-up posts covering the variety of interesting technologies and techniques I am using, but first I wanted to talk about the company I am working with and give a brief overview of what I am doing. To meet my amazing colleagues here at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, you can check out my <a href="https://alexandermichels.github.io/blog/WelcomeToLA.html">Welcome To L.A.</a> post, but the focus of this article will be on the incredible work <a href="https://www.praedicat.com/">Praedicat</a> does and the interesting problems I will be helping them tackle this summer.</p>

    <p>Firstly, let me say that these people are incredible. They have been so welcoming, helpful, and friendly to our team, and it shows that their first priority in working with us is helping us grow as mathematicians, computer scientists, economists, and data scientists. Our academic mentor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stephendesalvo/">Stephen DeSalvo</a> has been giving us incredible advice and his passion for problem-solving is infectious and inspiring. The Data Science team at Praedicat, and in particular Urjit Patel, has also gone far out of their way to make themselves available to us and help us. During our time here, we also had the opportunity to talk extensively with Melissa Boudreau, the Senior Vice President of Modeling, who is insanely skilled when it comes to anything relating to risk and modeling. Last, but certainly not least, it was our pleasure to have a meeting with Dr. Robert T. Reville, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Praedicat, who has a really interesting background in economics, but what truly makes him stand out is his thoughtfulness and ingenuity.</p>

    <p>Praedicat, Inc. is an InsurTech that is doing ground-breaking work in risk-analysis by modeling the state and evolution of scientific literature to characterize the risk. Their goal is to make the world cleaner, safer, and healthier by identifying the emerging risk using the methodology based on the peer-reviewed scientific literature. By mining peer-reviewed science journals they are able to anticipate tomorrow's claims. Praedicat uses their incredibly sophisticated and innovative models in products such as <a href="https://www.praedicat.com/products/">CoMeta&#174; and Oortfolio&#174;</a> which provide unprecedented platform for identifying, underwriting and managing systemic liability risk. They compile and summarize all this data in easy-to-understand visualizations such as their Quindrex&#174;, Heat Maps, and Starburst, which makes the information digestable rather than just a hundreds of pages of text which would require work on the client's part to parse to come up with something actionable.</p>

    <p>So what am I doing with Praedicat? Well right now CoMeta&#174;’s assessment of risk is based on proprietary algorithms that extract information on Litagion® agents from over 10,000 peer-reviewed journals and from regulatory documents, but there is a lot more information out there. There are news articles and tons of other documents freely available on the internet, but of course the problem is that unlike the peer-reviewed journals Praedicat generally works with, the data on the web is generally unstructured, the credibility is questionable, and the conclusions are a bit harder to draw. So in a broad sense, we are helping Praedicat first find relevant information on the web by building a web crawler, and from there we need to use Natural Language Processing to process the data with the hopes we can come up with data that is useable for the Praedicat models. Obviously this is not an easy task and we have already hit a few bumps in the road and learned a few lessons the hard way, but I'll be sure to share what I have learned in the coming weeks. In future posts, I'll also talk a bit more about the tools and techniques we are using, so keep an eye out if you are interested in learning more about that!</p>

    <p>This has been a really interesting and eye-opening experience already, and I'm really looking forward to diving deeper into this work to help make the world cleaner, safer, and healthier with Praedicat.</p>
