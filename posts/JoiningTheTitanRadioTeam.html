    <p>Happy to announce that I'll be working for Titan Radio/WCN 24/7 this year as a Computer Technical Assistant. This be a great opportunity for me to apply all my theoretical knowledge of computer science in the context of music and television, two of my favorite hobbies. They have some really amazing hardware and software challenges which are going to be a lot of fun to tackle.</p>
    <p>As part of my job, I've been developing some software to update the weather while no one is on air. It has been an a great opportunity to practice my Python skills, work with some interesting APIs such as Google Cloud Text-To-Speech, and work with audio which I normally don't do, but will have to get used to in my new role.</p>
