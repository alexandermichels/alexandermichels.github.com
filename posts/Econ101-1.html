      Economics has always intrigued me, and perhaps even more intriguing is the general lack of knowledge of economics, which inspired me to start this series, "Econ 101" in the hopes of demystifying the wonderful world of economics. I'm also hoping to help you better understand the political landscape because regardless of your beliefs, knowing the theory and language of economics allows us to have intelligent and constructive conversations rather than Tweeting insults or altogether isolating ourselves in highly partisan bubbles. We live in a world full of "fake news," hyperpartisanism, and anti-intellectualism, making it is more important now than ever to ensure that we are properly informed with reputable sources so we can eloquently and respectfully defend our positions and bridge the gaps between us. So to that end, we will explore many topics together in an unbiased journey through economic theories and vocabulary, the United States' current and historical economic positions, and through economic policy.

      Before we begin our journey through economics, it is first important to understand how people make decisions. This forms the basis of economics, as the study of economics boils down to understanding how individuals, businesses, governments, and other participants in the economy (which we will collectively refer to as "agents"), behave and interact. We will loosely define an economy as "resources, trade, consumption, and production." So the United States' economy is the "resources, trade, consumption, and production" of the United States and we have billions of "agents" including the Federal Reserve, you, and I. Think about how insane that is, we have billions of agents constantly making decisions, trading, producing, and consuming and continually changing our economy.

      So how do these agents make decisions? Well the truth is we are not entirely sure, but we have a lot of theories that when pieced together give us a pretty good picture. The majority of the economic theory on decision making is borrowed from the mathematical fields of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">Decision Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a>. These fields would suggest that agents act rationally. We work to get the best outcome in each situation we are faced with. How do we define the "best outcome?" For the average person, if given the choice between $10,000 or an hour of free time, we would likely choose the money, but someone with more money than they know what to do with, for example Bill Gates, may not. Well we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">Utility Theory</a> and define things in terms of "utils" which are essentially happiness points. So this allows us to give a relative meaning to the "best outcome." To me the $10,000 might be 10 utils and the hour might be 1, while Bill Gates might see it as 1 and 10 respectively, but we both make our decisions to optimize our utils, to maximize our outcome. There are some problems in theory here, for example this works really well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_utility">linear utility</a>, however human beings are complex and if our wants are non-linear or dependent on each other or otherwise complicated, we may not the nice vectors we want to make things work.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important things to take away from this post however, is that our economic fantasy land of total rationality doesn't exist. Humans just aren't completely rational, as any human reading this knows. Economists have taken big strides in recognizing this recently and the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics">Behavioral Economics</a> is the study of this. There are well documented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_anomaly">market inefficiencies</a> which tells us that we need to consider more than nice equations in building a model for economic behavior. As amazing as the results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics">Neoclassical Economics</a> are (what Americans think of as "economics"), we have to face the fact that billions of agents continually making decisions of varying degrees of rationality and having to continually react to how the state of the economy changes as a result of their choices gives us a vastly complex system which isn't always rational. Behavior economists study how we make irrational decisions and the conclusion isn't that surprising: we don't dedicate all the time needed to make each decision. Of course we don't! Think about the simple case of gas: are we continually looking up the price of gas at various stations and planning our routes to ensure that we get exactly the lowest price or would we rather say "good enough" and not waste our time? We sacrifice the penny-per-gallon for our sanity, because making decision isn't free either. So rather than actually rationally thinking through the exact way to optimize our utility, we use a rule of thumb or we rely on anecdotal evidence like how our friend said the gas station on Third Street always has the cheapest gas, whether it's true or not.

      This is where we will leave off for the week, thinking about how we make decisions as it will be a recurring theme in our practical romp through economics and a key component of next week's discussion of capitalism.
