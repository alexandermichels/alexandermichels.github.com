  <p>Last week, Team Praedicat gave our Projects Day Presentation for the Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) at UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, bringing an end to an amazing summer. You can find our abstract for the talk, a few pictures, and our presentation slides below:</p>

  <blockquote>Analysts at Praedicat, Inc., need to manually profile companies for modeling actuarial risks. With a plethora of companies and business activities, manual search is a tedious process. Further, the analysis is generally performed on unstructured, non-uniform, and sporadic websites which makes it difficult to algorithmically search for the information needed and complex to determine the semantic meaning of the documents even when they are found. Our work attempts to tackle these problems by building an information extraction, classification, and aggregation system which procures information and compares the statements found in the documents to a credible knowledge base. Based on computational fact-checking, we are hoping this approach will produce a better information extraction and aggregation system.</blockquote>
