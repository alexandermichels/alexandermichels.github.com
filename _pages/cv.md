## [Research Experience](#research-exp)

**CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies**  
[CyberGIS Center](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and [CyberInfrastructure and Geospatial Information Laboratory](https://cigi.illinois.edu/)  
June 2019 - Present  
* At the labs I worked under Dr. Shaowen Wang, Dr. Anand Padmanabhan, and Dr. Jeon-Young Kang on the "Algorithms & Systems" and "Spatial Modeling" teams.
* Under the "Algorithms & Systems" team I primarily work to design, build, and administer cyberinfrastructure. Projects include [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/), [Kubernetes-based CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/e9686eadd4474b6587d83d9330d25854/), and the [WhereCOVID-19 App's Spatial Accessibility Explorer](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/).
* Developed Docker-based Hadoop cluster for educational and research applications.
* Under the "Spatial Modeling" team, I wrote and published multiple spatial models for educational and research purposes.

**Informatics Researcher**  
Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA / Praedicat, Inc.  
June 2018 - August 2018
* Worked for Praedicat, Inc. automating information extraction, classification, and aggregation from web data for business profiling of over 52,600 companies and corporate entities.
* Worked for IPAM to develop a novel algorithm for computational fact-checking on knowledge graphs and a self-supervised machine learning algorithm for sentence importance which outperformed TF-IDF.
