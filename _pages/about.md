<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I'm pursuing a [doctorate in Informatics](http://www.informatics.illinois.edu/informatics-phd/) with a focus in Spatial Informatics. At UIUC I work as a research assistant under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the [CyberInfrastructure & Geospatial Information Laboratory (CIGI)](http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/). In these labs, I am part of the "Algorithms & Systems" and "Spatial Modeling" groups which allows me to explore deploying complex systems on Kubernetes and simulating complex socio-economic phenomena.

I have an interdisciplinary background which includes a Bachelors in Mathematics and Financial Economics with Honors in Computer Science and Math. This interdisciplinary undergrad from a liberal arts institution is now being supplemented by an intersectional graduate program that fits my research interests perfectly. I'm passionate about solving complex, data-driven, socio-economic problems involving space and connectivity, spurred on by an interest in graph theory and topology.

Some cool stuff I've been a (small) part of:
