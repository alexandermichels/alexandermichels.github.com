          <center><h2>Using ARIMA Models to Capture the Predictive Power of Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h2></center>
          <p>Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a model of intelligence based on the the interactions of pyramidal neurons in the mammalian neocortex currently being developed by <a href="numenta.com">Numenta.</a> It works by combining anology through metric-spaces, context-based representation of information, and the ability to predict multiple events per time step. It is able to do all of this by building synapses to learn transitions through states and representing data in <a href="http://www.cortical.io/science-sparse-distributed-representations.html">Sparse Distributed Representations</a>.For more info on Hierarchical Temporal Memory check out <a href="numenta.org">Numenta</a> or <a href="blog/WhatIsHierarchicalTemporalMemory.html">my blog post on HTMs</a>.</p>

          <p>It has stood out from other machine learning techniques due to high noise tolerance and learning compacity making it well-suited for anomaly detection, prediction, and sensorimotor processes. We seek to find a mathematical analogy to the predictive power of this biologically constrained theory using models for time series analysis. To do this, we statistically analyzed the error in predictions of HTM networks that we asked to predict outputs of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, varying the parameters of both the networks and the ARIMA models. We hope to to find a relation between sets of HTM network parameters and ARIMA model parameters to better explain the functions of each part of the neocortex and cortical learning algorithms in sequence memory.</p>

        <center><h2>Computational Fact-Checking through Relational Similarity based Path Mining</h2></center>
        <p>The volume of information today is outpacing the capacity of experts to fact-check it, and in the Information Age the realworld consequences of misinformation are becoming increasingly dire. Recently, computational methods for tackling this problem have been proposed with many of them revolving around knowledge graphs. We present a novel computational fact-checking algorithm, <i>RelPredPath</i>, inspired by and improving on the techniques used in state-of-the-art fact-checking algorithms, PredPath and Knowledge Stream. Our solution views the problem of fact-checking as a link-prediction problem which relies on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05911.pdf">discriminitive path mining</a>, but draws on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07239.pdf">relational similarity and node generality</a> to redefine path length. This gives our solution the advantage of training on more specific paths consisting of edges whose predicates are more conceptually similar to the target predicate. RelPredPath shows performance at-par with other state-of-the-art fact-checking algorithms, but leads to a more robust and intuitive model for computational fact-checking.</p>

        <center><h2>Information Extraction and Aggregation from Unstructured Web Data for Business Profiling</h2></center>
        <p>Analysts at <a href="https://www.praedicat.com/">Praedicat, Inc.</a>, need to manually profile companies for modeling actuarial risks. With a plethora of companies and business activities, manual search is a tedious process. Further, the analysis is generally performed on unstructured, non-uniform, and sporadic websites which makes it difficult to algorithmically search for the information needed and complex to determine the semantic meaning of the documents even when they are found. Our work attempts to tackle these problems by building an information extraction, classification, and aggregation system which procures information and compares the statements found in the documents to a credible knowledge base. Based on computational fact-checking, we are hoping this approach will produce a better information extraction and aggregation system.</p>

        <center><h2>Minimum Square Deviance k-Chinese Postman Problem</h2></center>
        <p>I worked on a <a href="docs/OnVariantsOfThek-ChinesePostmanProblem.pdf">variation of the k-Chinese Postman Problem</a> called the Minimum Square Deviance k-Chinese Postman Problem with Dr. Natacha Merz, specifically trying to find solutions for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">lattice graphs</a> like the square grid graph. Although we believe we made some headway, we were unable to prove any of our results because of the intractability of the problem.</p>

        <center><h2>Algorithmic Game Theory</h2></center>
        <p>I worked with my advisor Dr. Carolyn Cuff during the spring of my sophomore year to perform research into Algorithmic Game Theory and developing simple machine learning algorithms in Java to play repeated play game such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">Chicken</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_game">Colonel Blotto Game</a>. The experience taught me a lot about algorithms, Game Theory, time-complexity, and machine learning. It also gave me my first experience writing a solo research paper, "Strategies in Simulated Repeated Play Game Theory". I presented my results at <a href="docs/2017-urac-schedule.pdf">Westminster's 2017 Undergraduate Research and Arts Celebration</a> and the <a href="docs/MAA2017Abstracts.pdf">Mathematical Association of America's Allegheny Mountain Section 2017 Spring Meeting</a>.</p>

        <center><h2>Optimizing Throughput, Cost, and Safety in Toll Booth Plazas</h2></center>
        <p>I took on this problem as part of <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/">COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a>. We were given 72 hours to decide between a few problems, research, model a solution, and write a paper. Our <a href="docs/2017_MCM_Problem_B.pdf">problem</a> was to look for better solutions (shapes, size, and merging patterns) which could improve on the throughput, cost, and safety of toll booth plazas after tolls.</p>
        <center><img src="images/HorseshoeMerge.jpg" style="width:30em" /></center>
        <p>Our <a href="docs/ProblemB.pdf">solution</a> was to use something we called a Horseshoe merge. It reduces the cost of construction for most toll booth plazas, is safer, and we do not believe it restricts throughput. Our submission received an Honorable Mention and we presented our results at the <a href="docs/PME2017Program.pdf">2017 PME Regional Conference</a>.</p>
