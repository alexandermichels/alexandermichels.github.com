        <center><h2>Computational Fact-Checking Using Knowledge Graphs</h2></center>

        <p>Working with Himanshu Ahuja, we developed a new algorithm for computational fact-checking on knowledge networks called <i>RelPredPath</i> based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07239.pdf">network flow, relational similarity,</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05911.pdf">discriminative path mining</a></p>

        <p>We presented our work at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics and are continually improving the algorithm in the hopes of publishing a paper and presenting elsewhere.</p>

        <center><h2>An Exploration of the Topological and Logical Properties of Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h2></center>
        <p>Hierarchical Temporal Memory is a ground-breaking kind of biologically-inspired artificial intelligence modeled after the human neocortex. It works by combining anology through metric-spaces, context-based representation of information, and the ability to predict multiple events per time step. It is able to do all of this by building synapses to learn transitions through states and representing data in <a href="http://www.cortical.io/science-sparse-distributed-representations.html">Sparse Distributed Representations</a>.For more info on Hierarchical Temporal Memory check out <a href="numenta.org">Numenta</a> or <a href="blog/WhatIsHierarchicalTemporalMemory.html">my blog post on HTMs</a>.</p>
        <center><img src="images/hierarchy.png" style="width:20em" /></center>
        <p>My <a href="https://github.com/alexandermichels/HonorsResearch/blob/master/Honors_Research_Proposal.pdf">proposed work</a> is to focus on exploring the topology of the sparse distributed representations in the hopes of improving the decoding process currently in use. I am also hoping to implement some soft computing and fuzzy logic concepts to the system. It is my belief that the fuzzy logic in conjuction with the topological insights gained will lead to a system that is able to make more accurate predictions.</p>

        <center><h2>Information Extraction and Aggregation from Unstructured Web Data for Business Profiling</h2></center>
        <p>Analysts at <a href="https://www.praedicat.com/">Praedicat, Inc.</a>, need to manually profile companies for modeling actuarial risks. With a plethora of companies and business activities, manual search is a tedious process. Further, the analysis is generally performed on unstructured, non-uniform, and sporadic websites which makes it difficult to algorithmically search for the information needed and complex to determine the semantic meaning of the documents even when they are found. Our work attempts to tackle these problems by building an information extraction, classification, and aggregation system which procures information and compares the statements found in the documents to a credible knowledge base. Based on computational fact-checking, we are hoping this approach will produce a better information extraction and aggregation system.</p>

        <center><h2>Minimum Square Deviance k-Chinese Postman Problem</h2></center>
        <p>I worked on a <a href="docs/OnVariantsOfThek-ChinesePostmanProblem.pdf">variation of the k-Chinese Postman Problem</a> called the Minimum Square Deviance k-Chinese Postman Problem with Dr. Natacha Merz, specifically trying to find solutions for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">lattice graphs</a> like the square grid graph. Although we believe we made some headway, we were unable to prove any of our results because of the intractability of the problem.</p>

        <center><h2>Algorithmic Game Theory</h2></center>
        <p>I worked with my advisor Dr. Carolyn Cuff during the spring of my sophomore year to perform research into Algorithmic Game Theory and developing simple machine learning algorithms in Java to play repeated play game such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">Chicken</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_game">Colonel Blotto Game</a>. The experience taught me a lot about algorithms, Game Theory, time-complexity, and machine learning. It also gave me my first experience writing a solo research paper, "Strategies in Simulated Repeated Play Game Theory". I presented my results at <a href="docs/2017-urac-schedule.pdf">Westminster's 2017 Undergraduate Research and Arts Celebration</a> and the <a href="docs/MAA2017Abstracts.pdf">Mathematical Association of America's Allegheny Mountain Section 2017 Spring Meeting</a>.</p>

        <center><h2>Optimizing Throughput, Cost, and Safety in Toll Booth Plazas</h2></center>
        <p>I took on this problem as part of <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/">COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a>. We were given 72 hours to decide between a few problems, research, model a solution, and write a paper. Our <a href="docs/2017_MCM_Problem_B.pdf">problem</a> was to look for better solutions (shapes, size, and merging patterns) which could improve on the throughput, cost, and safety of toll booth plazas after tolls.</p>
        <center><img src="images/HorseshoeMerge.jpg" style="width:30em" /></center>
        <p>Our <a href="docs/ProblemB.pdf">solution</a> was to use something we called a Horseshoe merge. It reduces the cost of construction for most toll booth plazas, is safer, and we do not believe it restricts throughput. Our submission received an Honorable Mention and we presented our results at the <a href="docs/PME2017Program.pdf">2017 PME Regional Conference</a>.</p>
